    "Before we get started, we'll first need some text! Grab two [plain text files from Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) (or from another source of your choice) and save them to the same directory as this notebook. (I suggest working with two files because we'll be running some code explicitly to \"compare\" two texts. Also, I think seeing two different outputs from the text generation methods discussed in this notebook will help you better understand how those methods work.) The code in the following cell loads into Python variables the contents of *two plain text files*, assigned to variables `text_a` and `text_b`. You'll need to replace the filenames with the names of the files that you downloaded, keeping the quotation marks (`\"`) intact."
